### Project Description

This teamwork was carried out within the framework of the WEB project taught in the telecommunication department of INSA Lyon. 


The aim of this project was to discover the basics of the dynamic web and to produce an application using MERN stack (more details [here](https://www.mongodb.com/mern-stack#:~:text=MERN%20stands%20for%20MongoDB%2C%20Express,a%20client%2Dside%20JavaScript%20framework "About MERN Stack")). 

We have decided to create a website for skill-sharing announces. You can then create and manage an account, post ads and view all the ads online in a timeline. 

### How to run and use the program
